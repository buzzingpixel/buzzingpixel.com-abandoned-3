Working with images in a CMS can be quite painful. How can content editors use images that fit in the design while developers make sure it meets minimum/maximum requirements, and still get the part of the image thatâ€™s relevant?

Ansel is here to alleviate that pain. Ansel is a field type that provides a drag and drop image upload experience, an image cropping experience right in the field type that is **non-destructive** to the source image, and at the click of a button, content managers can also set the focal point of that cropped and manipulated image.
